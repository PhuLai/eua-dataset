# EUA Datasets

This repository maintains a set of EUA datasets which we collected from real-world data sources. The datasets are publicly released 
to facilitate research in Edge Computing. Feel free to contact us if you have any comments or questions. 
We would love to hear from you on ideas to improve the datasets.

All the data is in Australia region.

- _edge-servers_ folder: contains datasets of edge server locations.
- _users_ folder: contains datasets of user location.

Below is an example of edge servers with their coverages and end-users.
